# fhe-assignment-alexa-skill
An Alexa skill to record which family members have what assignments each week for Family Home Evening and rotate them automatically each week.

Members of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.mormon.org/) spend an evening together with their families once a week to strengthen family ties.  See more about Family Home Evening [here](https://www.lds.org/topics/family-home-evening/purpose?lang=eng&old=true).

This project is a Crazy Friday project of the Office of IT (OIT) at Brigham Young University. Crazy Friday is OIT's R&D time.

My family keep our assignment schedule previously in a Google Spreadsheet but even that felt cumbersome compared to the amazing ease of use and almost fritionless voice interface experience of the Amazon Echo.
