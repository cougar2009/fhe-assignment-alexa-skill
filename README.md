# FHE Assignments Alexa Skill
An Alexa skill to record which family members have what assignments each week for Family Home Evening and rotate them automatically each week.

Members of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.mormon.org/) spend an evening together with their families once a week to strengthen family ties. We abbreviate it FHE. See more about Family Home Evening [here](https://www.lds.org/topics/family-home-evening/purpose?lang=eng&old=true).

My family kept our assignment schedule previously in a Google Spreadsheet but even that felt cumbersome compared to the amazing ease of use and almost frictionless voice interface experience of Amazon Echo devices.

## One-time Setup

Say, "Alexa, enable family home evening assignments".

## Usage

Just say:
"Alexa, open family home evening assignments"
or
"Alexa, start family home evening assignments"

You can always run the setup again to fix errors or make changes by saying, "Alexa, tell FHE assignments to run setup."
