Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us.

It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any personal information we collect while operating this Alexa skill.

We will collect and use personal information solely for the purposes necessary to run the Alexa skill and will only use said personal information for those purposes unless required to do otherwise by law.  Currently, the only personal information we collect is whatever family member first names you choose to use in the skill.  You may use false or real names at your discretion.

To delete all of your information from the Alexa skill just say, "Alexa, tell FHE assignments to run setup".  Once it asks you if you want to run setup, say "Yes".  At this point, all of your personal information is completely deleted from our system.  Just say "Cancel" at this point to skip the rest of the setup process.  Your personal information may also be included in log files which will be deleted automatically 30 days after their creation.

We may change this privacy policy from time to time at our sole discretion.
